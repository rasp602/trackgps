# Leaflet in SvelteKit with renderless components

This is a very simple demo of how to use Leaflet in SvelteKit with renderless components. The ideas behind this implementation are described in the video.

[![Leaflet in SvelteKit](http://img.youtube.com/vi/JFctWXEzFZw/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFctWXEzFZw 'Leaflet in SvelteKit')

The project was bootstrapped with the SvelteKit CLI and [Tailwind was added](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/sveltekit) (optional).

Note that this is not a complete Leaflet implementation. Use it as inspiration or starting point to implement whatever you really need from Leaflet in your project!

## Developing

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
